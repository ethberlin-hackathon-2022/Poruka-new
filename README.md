## Project Description
Poruka is a credit coordination layer that enables users to set 
their own interest terms, and reshapes interest into a positive-sum 
mechanism for community savings. Poruka fetches your real-life 
address book to connect you with people you would want to open a 
lending relationship with. Lenders decide if they will charge interest 
to the borrower, and if so, half the interest goes to the lender, and 
half to a community savings account.  

## How it works
1. Sign in with your wallet:
   If previously connected with IDriss, people you are already connected with will appear on a list. Select the people you want to add as a contact. Otherwise, you can add contacts by inputting their wallet addresses.

Lender:
2. Select people:
   Select the people you want to extend a line of credit to, input the amount you are providing, and if desired, choose what interest rate you would like to lend at. 

Borrower:
2. Select offers:
   Select which credit lines you would like to withdraw from and input the amount you want to withdraw. 

3. Reimburse your line:
   If expected, pay back your provider by inputting the amount field.
